# Scalability Implementation Plan

## 1. Caching Layer

### Implementation
- Add Redis caching service
- Cache the following:
  - Classification results (keyed by file hash)
  - Feature extraction patterns
  - Industry configurations
  - OpenAI API responses for similar content

### Cache Strategy
- TTL for different cache types:
  - Classification results: 24 hours
  - Feature patterns: 1 hour
  - Industry configs: 1 hour
  - API responses: 12 hours

### Success Metrics
- Cache hit rate > 80%
- Response time reduction by 50%
- Cost reduction in API calls by 40%

## 2. Batch Processing

### Implementation
- New endpoint: `/classify_batch`
- Celery task queue integration
- Progress tracking system
- Batch result storage in Redis

### Components
- Task Queue Manager
- Progress Tracker
- Result Aggregator
- Failure Handler

### Success Metrics
- Process 100k documents/day
- Average processing time < 2s/document
- 99.9% task completion rate
- Zero task queue overflow

## 3. Rate Limiting & Queue

### Implementation
- Token bucket algorithm for rate limiting
- Priority queue system
- Client tier management
- Request throttling

### Components
- Rate Limiter Service
- Queue Manager
- Priority Handler
- Throttle Controller

### Success Metrics
- Zero service overload incidents
- 99% request acceptance rate
- < 1s queue wait time for priority clients
- < 5s queue wait time for standard clients

## 4. Performance Monitoring

### Implementation
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Grafana dashboards
- Performance logging
- Alert system

### Metrics to Track
- Request latency
- Queue length
- Processing time
- Error rates
- Cache hit/miss ratio
- API call costs
- Resource utilization

### Success Metrics
- 100% metric collection uptime
- < 1s metric query response time
- Alert triggering within 30s
- 95th percentile latency < 2s
